# Solve the following using either while/do while loops
1) Take a number from the user and print sum from 1 to that number 
2) Take a number from the user and print all prime numbers from 1 to that number 
pseudo code :
--------------
accept input from the user 
loop from 1 to that number
	is_prime(loop_iteration_number) which will return
	the true if the loop_iteration_number is a prime number
	Based on the return value determine if you need to print the 
	loop_iteration_number
	
def is_prime(input_number):
loop from 2 to that input_number/2
    if the input_number is divisible by the current loop counter
	    terminate the loop and return false 
	return true	
3) Take a number from the user and print all Odd numbers from 1 to that number 
4) Take a number from the user and print all Even numbers from 1 to that number 
5) Take a number from the user and print fibonacci sequence till that number
	eg : fibonnaci sequence for 5 is 0,1,1,2,3,5
